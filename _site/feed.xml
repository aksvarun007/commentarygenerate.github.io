  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Caffe is the deep learning framework created by a Phd student at UC Berkeley. It is well documented and has easy installation instructions. Information on the framework can be found at http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/ . But we had a different problem altogether. We were not provided sudo access on the GPU. As a results we cannot install any software as a root user. Fortunately, most of the dependencies as Blas, Open CV, Cuda libraries, etc were already installed. Three of the dependencies namely glog, gflag, lmdb were not installed and had to be installed from the source files. This took some time but was figured out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of libraries were depreciated and required some workaround. Most of such errors were rectified step by step. We ran the installer and tried to correct the errors thrown during the installation. this required us to locate the new names for the missing files and via &lt;code&gt;locate&lt;/code&gt; command in linux and link them to the correct parh via &lt;code&gt;ln -s destination source&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used Anaconda for the python dependencies and this required us to include google.protobuf in python sys.path (search it present as installation of python 2.7 generally) which was shown to be missing. the issues page on github repositories provided of specific help for example: one such instance required us to rename the libm.so file in the lib folder in the anaconda python distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After caffe installation, the rcnn installation was pretty straightforward and we just cloned the repository and followed the steps mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much effort, we were able to install the caffe framework with rcnn and we could run our first cnn( convoluted neural net) code for object detection.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year I visited the CMU-NITK Winter School organised by Carnegie Mellon University at National Institute of Technology, Karnataka. It was a wonderful opportunity and exposed me to large number of interestig topics in the field of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Winter School began on 10 December. After some introductory lectures, we were asked to brainstorm and come up with some interesting ideas that we would like to execute in a short span of just 15 days. This whole procedure was quite interesting and we considered a lot of interesting fields. We had a group of four team members each from different background. This was great as it exposed us to a realm of whole lot of new interesting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that we had only a span of 15 days for the project, we came up with a rather ambitious idea. We decided to make an application that can generate commentary for any match given just its video. This was an interesting problem and more importantly it was a great learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some excellent guidance from the mentors, we were able to modularize the whole problem statement into discrete parts. Owing to the non availability of data, we restricted ourselves to generation of commentary for tennis matches. Given a video of a tennis match, we tried to find the key elements that can characterise the important information of the match. We divided the whole problem statement as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Court Detection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Object Recognition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Action Recognition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Audio Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ball tracking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Commentary Generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We divided the task among the four team members and set on to our tasks individually. However, we had to face a lot of challenges in the early phase before we can formalise our approach. The major drawback  was the non availability of action labelled data for any sports dataset. We were not left with any other choice but to annotate data ourselves. We created a HTML 5 application utilising HTML 5 canvas that required the user to move around the rectangles, find the bounding box for the action region and label the corresponding part. I will try improving the code and provide it as an annotation tool as well share the annotated sports action dataset for tennis matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we plunged to the job of object recognition. So we were discovered that  RCNN (Regions with Convoluted Neural Networks) gave pretty superior results for object recognition as compared to other techniques and had a pre trained model on imagenet dataset which can be used directly. Since running the code for required a GPU, we were fortunately provided GPU access from IIT Bombay. Thereafter this began the next challenging part, installation of caffe and rcnn toolbox on the GPU………………&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/money.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing A&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without^M
chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the^M
six months that they need for digestion.”
^M
I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some^M
work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my ﬁrst drawing.
My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sticker-mule.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing Number One&quot; /&gt;
^M
I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the^M
drawing frightened them.
^M
But they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a^M
hat?”
^M
My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor^M
digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it,^M
I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the^M
grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained.
