 It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing:

 ![Drawing A]({{ site.url }}/images/money.jpg)

 In the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without^M
chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the^M
six months that they need for digestion.”
^M
I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some^M
work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my ﬁrst drawing.
My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:

^M
I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the^M
drawing frightened them.
^M
But they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a^M
hat?”
^M
My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor^M
digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it,^M
I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the^M
grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained.
